# Xbuilder

## Fast and easy code builder written in Bash.

Xbuilder is written in form of a library.
To use it in another scripts, you have to source it by
```sh
source xbuilder.sh
# or
. xbuilder.sh
# which is exactly the same
```
If you doesnt't want to source it, but to use it immadiately, you can use `xbuilder-worker` script.
Both `xbuilder.sh` and `xbuilder-worker` are installed into the same install directory, which defaultly is `/usr/bin`.
To install it, there is a command `xbuilder__install` and to get some help you may use `xbuilder__help`.

Good fun! :)

# Xbuilder

## Fast and easy code builder written in Bash.

Xbuilder is written in form of a library.
To use it in another scripts, you have to source it with
```sh
source xbuilder.sh
# or
. xbuilder.sh
# which is exactly the same
```
To install it, there is a command `xbuilder__install` and to get some help you may use `xbuilder__help`.

Good fun! :)
